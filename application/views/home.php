                    <p>The Rawḍah Madrasah at Mustafa Mount was launched on the 12th Rabi ul Awwal 1445
                        (23<sup>rd</sup>
                        September 2023) and our first day of teaching was on Monday 2<sup>nd</sup> October.
                        The educational vision of the madrasah is inspired by the teachings of al Habib ‘Umar
                        ibn Hafiz and the traditional education of Dar al- Mustafa and Dar al- Zahrā in Tarim. Our
                        central focus will be to
                        teach
                        the students how to love the Prophet ﷺ and embody his ﷺ character and teachings.

                        Students at the Rawḍah Madrasah will learn about Qur’ānic Arabic, the Language of
                        Arabic,
                        and various Islamic subjects such fiqh, character and sira studies. In order to instil prophetic spirit and culture in our students they will have prophetic food
                        as refreshments and have the opportunity to participate in a prophetic sport.

                        Our vision for the madrasah is to create an inspiring learning culture and ethos so our
                        students:</p>
                    <ul class="marker">
                        <li>can learn how to become balanced individuals in terms of spirituality, academia and
                            sport,</li>
                        <li>have a strong Islamic and ethical direction for exhibiting good character and
                            manners,
                        </li>
                        <li>and have a disposition in refraining from activities which can be harmful to them or
                            to
                            their family or community.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <!-- <p>We endeavour to bring the best teachers in the Islamic tradition to teach our students
                        and we
                        feel that our students will learn, enjoy and be happy in our learning environment.

                <div class="col-md-7 vision-content">
                    <h2 class="section-title">Our Vision</h2>
                    <p>To nurture children who: </p>
                    <ul class="marker">
                        <li>Know God, </li>
                        <li>Understand the central importance of the Messenger of God ﷺ as the embodiment of the
                            pre-eternal word of God,
                        </li>
                        <li>Are fully equipped to serve Him.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Knowing God implies the knowledge and experience required to fulfil the sacred covenant.
                        This
                        is the essence of the Rawḍah.

                        The Messenger of God ﷺ, is the means by which God communicates His pre-eternal word to
                        creation. This is made manifest in the words, actions, states and character of the
                        Messenger
                        of God ﷺ. Knowledge and understanding of his ﷺ central importance will lead to love and
                        imitation of him ﷺ and thereby a higher divine experience.

                        ‘Equipped to serve Him’ means that we want to provide the necessary spiritual,
                        intellectual,
                        physical and educational instruments that will assist in the fulfilment of their duty to
                        God, in the optimal manner.</p>
