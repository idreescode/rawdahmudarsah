                    <h4>Homework
                    </h4>
                    <p>Rawḍah Madrasah is primarily focused on children developing fluency in both the Arabic language and Qur’ānic literacy. For this to be achieved, parents are asked to ensure that children complete the requisite homework tasks and revision for each subject that they study.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Uniform</h4>
                    <p>Parents are asked to ensure that children adhere to the below guidance such that children are always dressed in a manner that is befitting for gatherings of sacred knowledge:</p>
                    <ul class="marker">
                        <li>Loose fitting clothing with the awrah completely covered for both boys and girls - no skinny jeans, shorts, football shirts, leggings or tights will be permitted at all within the Madrasah.</li>
                        <li>Head must be covered for both boys and girls - with a white kufi for boys and white hijab for girls.</li>
                        <li>Boys - white thawb or long shirt and loose trousers.</li>
                        <li>Girls - black abaya or long loose fitting dress with arms covered.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>If children are not dressed in line with the above guidance then in the first instance parents will be sent a message reminding them of the uniform expectations. If this becomes a repeated issue then children will be asked to sit out of the lesson and parents will be asked to drop off the correct clothing for children to wear before they will be permitted to participate in lessons.</p>

                    <h4>Timings</h4>
                    <p>Rawḍah Madrasah takes place Monday to Friday 16.30-18.30.
                        Children can be dropped off from 16.20 at the earliest and parents must ensure that children are not left unsupervised in the building prior to this time.
                        Children must be collected by 18.40, any collections after this time will be subject to a late collection fee of £5 which will be invoiced automatically for each late collection.
                        Any changes to your child's collection arrangements must be sent via email before 16.00. Without written parental consent, children will not be allowed to leave with anyone other than their parent/ guardian.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Manners</h4>
                    <p>We expect all visitors to Felicity House and Mustafa Mount to exhibit appropriate manners when visiting the building. This includes:</p>
                    <ul class="marker">

                        <li>Upholding appropriate behaviour towards staff, students, neighbours and the building at all times this includes not causing a disturbance to others due to noisy or boisterous activities.</li>
